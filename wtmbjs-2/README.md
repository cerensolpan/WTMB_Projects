# WTM Berlin - Homework 2

1.  Create a node.js project by running  `npm init`
2.  Split your classes from last week's homework into different files.  _Export_  them as  _modules_  and  _require_  them in your  `index.js`
3.  Search npmjs.com for a library that could fit to your project.
4.  Install that library to your project using  `npm install`  and  `require`  that library in your code.
5.  Using the  `database.js`  module introduced this week, save one or more of your classes into JSON files.
